.SH NAME
four2perm - generate permuted index from four-field lines
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B four2perm
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I four2perm
expects input lines with four tab-separated fields, such as that
created from HTML files by html2four(1). Given that, it does most
of the work of generating a permuted index, gets things close
enough that a simple pipeline through sort(1) and awk(1) can
finish the job.
